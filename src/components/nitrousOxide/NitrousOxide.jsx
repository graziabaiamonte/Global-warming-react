                    Nitrous oxide is a gas that is produced by the combustion of
                    fossil fuel and solid waste, nitrogen-base fertilizers, sewage treatment
                    plants, natural processes, and other agricultural and industrial activities.
                    It is the third largest heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere and the biggest
                    ozone-destroying compound emitted by human activities.

                    whether the Nâ‚‚O concentration is increasing, decreasing or remaining stable
                    in time. The trend can be calculated using statistical models or
                    data analysis algorithms to identify patterns or changes in the course
                    weather.
