                    Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological processes.
                    Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems and wetlands.
                    50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human activities.
                    These include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems, waste from homes and businesses,
                    landfills, and so on. Methane is a gas with a global warming potential several
                    times stronger than of CO2. For more than 650,000 years, methane concentration in
                    the atmosphere was between 350 â€“ 800 ppb. From the beginning of the industrial revolution,
                    human activities have increased this amount by around 150%
